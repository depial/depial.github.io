## **Introduction - The Pieces**

Since we are talking about learning, the pieces of the game can only be information. A little anticlimactic, but there it is. At least I didn't lead you on too much. In what lies ahead, I'll be trying to convey some bits of information (which make up my perspective on the game) in the best manner I can muster. In doing this, I find it hard to decide which point of view to write in: first person plural (i.e. We), first person singular (i.e. I), second person singular (i.e. You), etc. All of them have benefits and drawbacks. For example, first person plural has the benefit of being inclusive, since we're all in this together, right? However, it also can come off as morally imperialistic, since it could be understood to mean that it is taken for granted that everyone would agree immediately upon hearing what is shared. First person singular has the benefit of being more easily seen in a morally relative light, meaning it's easier to understand it as a personal opinion which need not apply to anyone other than the person sharing it. However, it also can more easily end up contributing to the confusion between the message and the messenger (possibly resulting the unnecessary lionization and/or demonization of said messenger). The problem is particularly difficult to resolve in a general manner since each person, with their unique proclivities, will naturally gravitate towards one interpretation or the other, while even changing affinity from page to page. In the end, I would hope that you can try to keep in mind that I'm only trying to explain one perspective, which is still evolving, and not some absolute truth which is static in time, I think. To help absorb this, I would like to invite readers to consider the following:

- Other perspectives don't need to replace our own; instead they can be used to augment each other. For example, if you were standing on one side of a mountain, seeing nothing but a verdant valley in front of you, and someone came from the other side and told you there is a pristine lake at the base of the mountain, would you think it wise to argue that only one of you could be correct? Here, considering you presumably couldn't see the other side, both of you could be correct, and it might be a bit obtuse (thanks eternal to Shawshank Redemption for that word) to argue otherwise. What's more, adding the two perspectives together could help you go from a two-dimensional view of the world, to a three-dimensional concept of the world, a truly powerful leap.
- Beware of cherry picking. In the example above, instead of rejecting the other person's claim outright, we could take in the bits we agree with and reject/ignore those we don't. So, when they tell us we are on a mountain, we would unquestioningly accept this, but when they tell us there is a lake at the base, we could convince ourselves that they are just seeing a mirage in the lush valley below. This *confirmation bias* works to reinforce our preexisting beliefs and would leave us with the less flexible two-dimensional view of the world. This is why it's often beneficial to at least, *in good faith*, consider or question information which is respectively contrary to or in line with our beliefs. After all, maybe we're not on a mountain, but we were unknowingly put into a room with a really good VR setup. Scientists have been known to do stranger things.

A quick note on format: scattered throughout this writing, there will be drop-down cubby-holes (for lack of a better term) which aim to give more detail on a certain topic. There may even be cubby-holes inside cubby-holes (ad nauseam), which makes the structure more like a rabbit hole (which is probably what made me think of the word cubby-hole in the first place). These digressions could be skipped if they are found to be too technical or abstract, but it's good to at least give them a go, since something may click further on down the road. Our first two are below:

<details>
<summary id="phases-of-perspectives">Phases of Perspectives</summary>

There are a few ways that people seem to treat differing perspectives: absolutely inclusive, mutually exclusive, and mutually inclusive. 

**Absolutely Inclusive**

The absolutely inclusive phase is how we tend to see things as a child, where we believe everyone sees the world the same way we do, and the thought that someone could see it differently is alien. This is also known as egocentrism, and usually fades with world experience, but we usually carry some level of it with us (e.g. this is one reason some people who are good at doing something can be quite poor at teaching it), and how much is carried varies person to person, and aspect to aspect. This phase is typified by a monolithic view of the world, in which everyone's perspective is equal but only because they are presumed to be the same as the holder's.

**Absolutely Exclusive/Mutually Exclusive**

The exclusive phase has two sub-phases which are accompanied by the belief that one perspective is either *right* (absolutely exclusive) or that it is somehow *better* (mutually exclusive). The former sees differing perspectives as incompatible, marked by a feeling of competition or threat when faced by one different than our own, often resulting in intolerance since it is believed that one perspective must supplant the other. The latter sees differing perspectives as having value in and of themselves, but that either the holder's (or the holder's idol) is the *best*, and this can result in "snobbish tolerance". Both of these aspects are typified by a competitive view of the world, with the main difference being in the amount of willingness to accept diversity.

**Mutually Inclusive**

The mutually inclusive phase is where true tolerance is found. Differing perspectives are seen as an opportunity to expand our own, which, in turn, increases our flexibility/fluidity/fluency in our interactions with others. Interestingly, analogously to the other inclusive phase, this phase also has a monolithic view of the world, namely that we share access to a type of omniperspective, but we can note our own deficiencies in being finite and, therefore, the value that others hold in helping fill those. Pride in one is replaced by appreciation of the whole.

**Endgame**

I describe these as phases, and they proceed in the order given. As far as I know, there is no way to skip a phase, which makes it akin to a learning experience, and, as such, no phase is "better" or "more correct" than any other. They just need to be worked through like you have been learning throughout your life (assuming you're willing to move ahead anyway). Most interestingly of all, in the end, when taken as a whole, they can be called upon and used flexibly if and when a situation calls for them. In other words, they become tools in our interaction toolbox, rather than something we rigidly identify with, and this point can only be reached by appreciating every step.

<summary id=confirmation-bias>Confirmation Bias</summary>

The second bullet point above is referring to [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). In short, this is how we tend to try to reinforce our current beliefs. Effectively we accept information that appears to be inline with our beliefs and reject that which is not. This process is often marked by mindlessly handling information based on this litmus test. So, you can mindlessly accept information just as easily as you can mindlessly reject it.

Confirmation bias is present in different levels depending on which phase of perspective we find ourselves in and is related to the fear we have of leaving the comfort zone of our notion of identity. 

- In the absolutely exclusive phase, it can be seen as being either not present, because one is unaware of the existence of other perspectives, or completely consuming, because we refuse to believe there is another perspective. It both is and isn't in this phase.
- In the exclusive phase, it is at its strongest expression in the absolutely exclusive sub-phase, with the shock of finding other perspectives providing a threat to our previously monolithic identity, so we try to assuage this fear with reinforcements for the perceived battle; moving into the mutually exclusive sub-phase, we are more open to accepting ideas which don't align with our perspective via increased curiosity, but acceptance may still take conscious effort due to fear still dominating.
- In the mutually inclusive phase, it has weakened sufficiently due to fear being overtaken by curiosity. Our identities are no longer seen as under constant threat. However, they may be understood as being incomplete, and, since accumulating further perspectives can be seen to make us more capable at handling the world, appreciation starts to give us a sense of security which supplants that given by confirmation bias.
- In the endgame, confirmation bias has disappeared after losing any further ability to soothe fear, seeing as fear itself has disappeared. The new paradigm is empathy, understanding of the other and ourselves. With this, we have found that the opposite of confirmation bias is empathy.

It's worth pointing out that perspectives are, in general, not the monolithic identities that most people mistake them for, but they are instead made up of countless pieces which we have picked up along the way and the interconnections between them, giving differing levels of expression to each. I like to think of a perspective very much in line with how a brain is structured, many nodes, with various connections between them, some being stronger than others, leading to distinct tendencies. In this way, the link between confirmation bias and fear is manifest in how we tend to apply it most to the areas of our perspective we most identify with, since undermining these areas often leads to some form of existential anxiety. What's more, this means that someone can have high confirmation bias in one area (e.g. political views), but have less in another (e.g. religious views). This could be how people who seem to be quite different can end up having a complementary relationship; one is flexible where the other is rigid.

We can also note that the beginning of the process is a (blurry) reflection of the end, where what was intuitive understanding gets backed up with intellectual understanding. For example, children are inherently curious, but this general curiosity tends to wane (perhaps to becoming more specialized), being replaced by fear, until it starts to re-emerge, largely through conscious effort, once again near the end of the process. An image of a pendulum comes to mind, where one swing takes us from the start to the finish, and we are learning along the trajectory, so we end up in the same place, but with the experience of the voyage.

If you've skipped the cubby-holes, the two points above can be taken on faith, but only for now. Often we have to start with an assertion before breaking it down and thoroughly examining it to finally arrive at an independent understanding. By the end of the first section, these points may become clear enough to the extent that they can be taken or rejected upon critical examination. If you read the whole thing, perhaps you'll be able to explore and find the full depth of the concepts behind these terse examples. If so, great! No promises though... It's taken me a lifetime to marginally clarify these things for myself and I'm still actively exploring. Work cannot be received, it must be done.

The interplay above, between options which seem to be mutually exclusive, will play out throughout this book, and their resolution is, therefore, of particular interest. For this reason, I won't be using one point of view or the other exclusively, since I haven't found this to be the answer, and I will try to find their resolution in their union. Hopefully we'll discover this resolution together, but in the meantime, please keep in mind that I intend to be inclusive without being imperialistic, and try to think of everything as an invitation to consider something with aspects which may or may not be able to augment your worldview, and try not to see it as an attempt at a wholesale replacement of it. Also, try not to accept *or* reject things without any critical consideration. Put your thinking caps on... Or your VR goggles. As you wish, but I can't guarantee the latter will have the intended effect.

## Part I - The Rules

Clearly, if we are to play the game, the next thing we'll need are some rules to play by. Fortunately, we instinctively know them from birth, but, unfortunately, they often become muddled over time and sometimes outright forgotten or ritualized over. Luckily they are very simple. In fact, there's just one main rule:

***Separation is impossibile***

Now that we have that vague, and likely \*bemusing, rule definition out of the way, we might want to look into some of the particulars to clarify what's actually going on. We'll be working with a "concrete" example, and an "abstract" one, and some of the details could get somewhat technicalish. When I find myself in this situation, I often aim for seeing the forest for the trees first by skimming the details to catch the wider picture, then going back in for more detail. For example, once I was learning a language and I was trying to understand every word in a book. The going was slow, but, while I was picking up vocabulary and grammar, I noticed I didn't have a good idea what the storyline of the book was. One day I lost my place and decided to read more quickly, skipping over any words I didn't quite understand (without ignoring them), until I got back to where I had left off. When I got there, I continued in this fashion and found that, even without understanding every word, I was getting the gist of the book. That said, I can only do this when I have already attained a certain level of familiarity with the subject, and reading word-by-word may be necessary at the beginning of any study. I just don't make it a habit which continues on, because habits are nasty little things, rigid and unexpressive to their core.

<details>
<summary>*Bemuse - A compromised definition</summary>

I've recently come to understand that many people use the word *bemuse* to mean *amuse*, while [the dictionary definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bemuse) is effectively *confuse*. I admit that I was a bit confused when I first saw it, since it sounds so close to *amuse* while not fitting the relevant context with that meaning, and, after looking it up, I was slightly amused with the resulting definition. In that spirit, and since we already have perfectly good words for *confuse* and *amuse* (namely *confuse* and *amuse*, respectively), I've adopted the following definition for bemuse:

*be·muse /bəˈmyo͞oz/*  
*verb*  
*verb: bemuse; 3rd person present: bemuses; past tense: bemused; past participle: bemused; gerund or present participle: bemusing*

*confuse (someone) in an amusing way.*  

Or more concisely: confuse + amuse = bemuse

Carry on.

### **Chapter 1 - Structure**

As we're talking about a learning game, it might be helpful to lay out the structure of what we are learning: information. This structure is quite general and revolves around the states of dichotomies, which the perceived world appears to be made up of. The two examples we'll be working with are the "Wanderer" and the "Point to Line". I feel like most people would say the former is a concrete example, since it relates to the "real world", and the latter is an abstract one. However, I feel this is backwards, since the former example feels like it has a façade over a more fundamental structure and this structure is shown more clearly by the "bare bones" latter example. But you say potato, I say potato...

**Wanderer**

The first example, more related to worldly matters, is the progression of the wanderer. 

1. A person with wanderlust generally will start as a vacationer, which means, when they want to get away, they will travel to an all-inclusive resort, a vacation home, or, more generally, something predictable and familiar. Novel cultural interaction is minimal, and it is almost as if the vacationer has brought their home with them to a new location, thus they have the same mentality as when at home.
2. The next phase starts when the vacationer has started to find more interest in the particular aspects of the places they travel to. There are two sub-phases here, which are marked by different levels of engagement with the cultures (or landscapes) they visit. The first sub-phase is for the tourists, who will likely prefer to see the most well-known sites. Here they are more culturally engaged than the vacationer, albeit in a fairly sterile or even stereotypical environment, but landmarks are likely the main target of the trip. The second sub-phase belongs to the travelers, who tend to shun the most famous tourist spots and look for unique destinations, further off the beaten path. The level of engagement with the local cultures (or landscapes) is much higher than the vacationer, and indeed may be the primary reason for the trip.
3. The third phase is that of the Citizen of the World (CoW? They are like the GOATs of wandering, so yes.), who are generally comfortable anywhere and don't tend to go out of their way to look for anything "special". They go with the flow and cultural engagement is so profound that the CoW feels at home almost anywhere. However, in contrast to the vacationer, this comfort is because they melt into their surroundings due to a heightened cultural fluidity. Wanderlust has been sated, but neither is there a sense of trepidation keeping them glued to any one place.

At the end of this process, a wanderer will be able to visit any of the places typical to the three phases without feeling uncomforable, making use of all the experience that came before, and without prejudice. On that note, I will point out once more, that, since this is a learning process, there is no "better" or "best" phase, there is just whatever phase one finds oneself in. However, it might be good to mention that not everyone sees it this way, so, if you meet a wanderer and you don't know what phase they are in, it's probably safest to go with calling them a traveler. This is because: a vacationer may not really know the difference; a tourist might be flattered, since they are often aspiring travelers; a traveler will likely be relieved you didn't call them a tourist; and a CoW probably won't care, because these definitions seem largely arbitrary and pointless in the end.

**Point to Line**

The second example is that of a zero-dimensional point to a one-dimensional line. This shows the learning game in action, albeit somewhat abstractly, so I've made a short [video](https://vimeo.com/672520254?share=copy) to help with visualization.

1. With a zero-dimensional point, it can be seen as a line with zero length or a circle with zero circumference with equal validity. It is both round and straight by being neither round nor straight. This is what I like to call a concrete singularity, but it can be called a paradox just as well. A paradox since, after all, how can something be round and straight at the same time? To see this, we can think of expanding our point in two different ways...
2. If we see it as a line, we can start increasing its length, and if we see it as a circle, we can start increasing its circumference. However, we can't do both at the same time, since lines and circles appear to be mutually exclusive. However, we can note that as we increase the circumference of the circle, the curvature starts to decrease, and the circle starts to look closer and closer to a line.
3. In the limit that the circumference goes to infinity, the curvature goes to zero and the circle becomes indistinguishable from an infinite line. Therefore, at infinity, the seemingly separate concepts merge once again, however this time it is both round and straight by being both round and straight.

These, in a nutshell, show (the linear nature of) the structure of information in the learning game and it appears to have three states:

1. Paradox
2. Dichotomy
3. Superposition

In words, the starting point is a paradox, which we then separate into a dichotomy, and, after exploring the full relationship between the elements, we are able to reunite them in a non-paradoxical way (i.e. superposition).

This process, as described, is probably most easily identifiable with the point to line example. There, we started with the paradoxical point, which is/isn't a line and/or a circle; separated it into the dichotomy of a line and a circle; then found they reunified when we increase the size to infinity (i.e. after we probed the whole range of possible values).

For the voyager example, the identifications might seem a bit more contrived. To see what makes a paradox, we might have to squint a bit, but it lies in the concept that the vacationer wants to travel, but also stay at home at the same time; the dichotomy is seen in the contrast of familiarity and unfamiliarity; and the superposition is seen in how the CoW can travel anywhere while always feeling at home, thus there is no desire to travel nor to stay put (which comes after experiencing the whole of the wandering spectrum).

Upon further inspection, we will see that this splits into four states of learning. Each of these states could be typified by a logical operator:

| Phase |         Name           | Logic |
|:-----:|:----------------------:|:-----:|
|  1    |  Concrete Singularity  |  NOR  |
|  2    |  Exclusive Dichotomy   |  XOR  |
|  3    |  Inclusive Dichotomy   |  OR   |
|  4    |  Abstract Singularity  |  AND  |

Table 1.1 - States/Phases of learning

<details>
<summary id="a-brief-word-on-logical-operators">A Brief Word on Logical Operators</summary>

The NOR and the AND operators are usually seen as how we intuitively use the words in English:

- NOR: Neither this nor that
- AND: Both this and that

However, the OR operator doesn't have a single word equivalent in colloquial English, while the XOR operator is used how we intuitively use the English word "or".

- XOR: This or that, but not both
- OR: This or that or both

So these can be thought of as the eXclusive OR and the inclusive OR, respectively. With this in mind, be careful when offering a logician Option A or Option B, as they may take both. Actually, I suppose jerks might also take both, without even knowing the logic, so it's probably best to be on your toes at all times, but I digress... Below, are the truth tables for these operations and understanding them could be helpful. However, it's not necessary, so don't worry if this is a bit over your head. If this is new for you, you can think of the colloquial terms and imagine the *1* to mean inclusion and the *0* to mean exclusion, and the *T/F* indicates the truth of the statement for that case.

|  A  |  B  | A NOR B | A XOR B |  A OR B | A AND B |
|:---:|:---:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  0  |  0  |    T    |    F    |    F    |    F    |
|  0  |  1  |    F    |    T    |    T    |    F    |
|  1  |  0  |    F    |    T    |    T    |    F    |
|  1  |  1  |    F    |    F    |    T    |    T    |

Table 1.2 - Truth tables for different phases of learning

For example, we have A NOR B only being true when A and B are 0, which is to say, when neither A nor B are included. On the other end A and B is true only when, happily, A and B are included. There are actually 16 of these tables for two items (with only four shown here), each with a distinct "meaning", but we'll use just these four as representatives for what I see as four groups of four.

<a href="#a-brief-word-on-logical-operators">Top of A Brief Word on Logical Operators</a>
</details>

I've introduced some new terminology for paradox and superposition, which is intended to be a bit more general. A singularity is meant to describe the inseparable union of two concepts. 

A concrete singularity is one which is intractable or inpenetrable to logic. For exammple, the liar paradox:

*This sentence is false.*

Here, the sentence says, about itself, that it is false. If this is the case, then the sentence must mean the opposite of what it says, which is to say it is true. But if it is true, it must be false... This oscillation between truth values cannot be removed from a re-examining (e.g. a rewording) of the problem, and it is an prime example of a paradox. However, in the example of the vacationer, wanting to travel but also wanting to stay at home is not so pathologically paradoxical, but rather cycliclally conflicting in another sense. This is why I'm introducing the more general term of concrete singularity.

The abstract singularity could be seen as the "resolution" to the concrete singularity, in that it has the same components, but now in a comprehensible structure. For example, the CoW doesn't really want to travel or stay at home because all places are seen as uniquely interesting at every moment in time. This along with their cultural flexibility, which allows them to feel at home in any environment, has disolved the wanderlust. For the liar paradox, a potential way to see an abstract singularity is to note that there is very little (or nothing?) in the world that can be said to be true or false with certainty. In other words, the world appears to be inherently uncertain, all the way down to the quantum level, where it's literally a foundational tenet. There are many worldly reflections of this which may seem somewhat removed, such as this uncertain nature being responsible for why legal systems grow so complex in time. People can continually find loopholes in laws which they can then exploit, these loopholes then will need patching, which then leads to new laws and new loopholes...
